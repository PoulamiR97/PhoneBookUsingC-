# PhoneBookUsingC++
Simulated a phone book, like the one we have in our house and use them to keep record of all the important numbers we need. 

For each contact, their name and their phone will be stored.
Also, we will be using a new and very powerful feature of the Standard Template Library of C++: vector. 

1) Instead of std::string own string class is used to store text fields like name, email etc.
2) Interface and implementation are separate.
3) Classes are designed as reusable components.
